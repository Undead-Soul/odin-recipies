    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large Russet Potato</li> 
        <li>1 tsp Salt + as needed for seasoning</li>
        <li>Oil - For frying</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper - for seasoning</li>
        <li>Red Chilli powder - for seasoning</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First choose a large potato. A potato with a smooth surface and close to cylindrical will be easy to work with. Wash and peel the skin of the potato.</li>
        <li>Fill a large bowl with cold water and place the potato slicer on top of the water bowl. Slice potatoes paper-thin across the width. Make sure that the potato slices immediately drop into the water. This will prevent the potato slices from browning. </li>
        <li>Once the whole potato is sliced up, wash the potato slices nicely in water for 2 or 3 times until the water runs out clean. This will remove any excess starch from the surface. Now, add about a tsp of salt to the bowl, mix well and leave the potato slices to soak up in water . </li>
        <li>After about 10-15 mins, remove the potato slices from the water and leave them to dry on a clean kitchen towel / paper napkins in a single layer. Meanwhile heat oil for frying. Once the oil is hot, reduce the flame to medium low and drop a batch of the potato slices. Continuously keep tossing up the potato slices in the oil, until they turn slightly golden brown and/or crisp. Remove the chips from the oil using a slotted spoon. You can spread it on a large baking sheet / cookie sheet lined with paper towels to drain the excess oil. </li>
        <li>Before adding the next batch remaining potato slices for frying, wait for a few mins. Make sure that the oil is back hot again.</li>
        <li>Taste the potato chips and add additional sea salt per taste, toss it up and enjoy a plain salted version. You will not need much salt though.</li>
        <li>Add red chilli powder to the chips and toss it up for a spicy chilli version</li>
        <li>Add freshly ground black pepper to the chips and toss it up for a spicy pepper version.</li>
        
    </ol>
